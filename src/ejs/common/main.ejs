    <h2>Flexbox Layout</h2>

    <p>Starting from the outside and working in, adding display: flex; to the container is the first step in any flexbox layout. The flex-direction is column, so this will position all sections under each other.    </p>

  <p>One handy thing is how easy it is to align text. In the navigation, with align-items: baseline, all navigation items are aligned to the baseline of the text so they look more uniform. </p>
